# MSD-Final-Project-React-Redux

* A full stack application using MERN stack. Previously built without Redux for my MSD program's final project, and have been refactoring it ever since for fun. Added many other features as well. Still a work in progess.

My app was based on and is similiar to the idea of twitch.tv. Where users can create a stream and either record or stream a live video from their computer screen. Features include: users favoriting other users streams, all CRUD operations for each users streams, every user who creates a stream is linked up to an Amazon Web Services notification system where they are notified when someone favorites their stream, react-redux, RESTful api's, modal, Google OAuth 2.0, and more.
