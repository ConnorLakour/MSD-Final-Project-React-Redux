# MERN Stack Streaming Application

Welcome to my MERN stack streaming application, an evolving project initially developed for my MSD program's final project. Since its inception, I've continuously refactored and enhanced it for both learning and fun. While it remains a work in progress, it has already undergone significant improvements.

## Project Overview

This application draws inspiration from platforms like Twitch.tv, allowing users to create streams and either record or live stream their computer screens. It encompasses a wide range of features, including:

- **User Interaction**: Users can favorite other users' streams, fostering a sense of community and engagement.

- **CRUD Operations**: The application supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each user's streams, giving users full control over their content.

- **AWS Notification Integration**: Every user who creates a stream is seamlessly integrated with Amazon Web Services' notification system. They receive alerts whenever someone favorites their stream, enhancing user engagement.

- **React-Redux**: The front-end of the application utilizes React in conjunction with Redux for efficient state management, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **RESTful APIs**: The application is built around a RESTful API architecture, promoting scalability, maintainability, and robustness.

- **Modal Implementation**: A modal component is employed for an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

- **Google OAuth 2.0**: Secure and user-friendly Google OAuth 2.0 authentication is integrated into the application to simplify user onboarding and access management.

...and much more.
